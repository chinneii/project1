# Schedule-TERA

The prototype shows the scheduling process and check-in of the user.
To begin using the prototype open home.html
Plan a trip by searching up the desired destination and add it to the list.
Once the list is complete save it and choose a date.
When the user approaches the coordinates as displayed, the user will be checked in automatically

NOTE:
A dummy link is provided when the user is being checked in using the prototype to simulate the link generation of the user's profile id and the location id.
